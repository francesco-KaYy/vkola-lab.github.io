We are one of the most interdisciplinary research groups in the world, bringing together trainees and scientists from computer science, neuroscience, bioinformatics, physics, computing and data sciences, electrical and computer engineering, and medicine. We actively collaborate with clinicians and domain experts across diverse specialties and institutions worldwide. This unique convergence of disciplines has enabled us to publish across the full spectrum of scientific inquiry, from top-tier journals like *Nature Medicine* to premier computer science venues such as the *International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*. **Our mission is to create methods to fit the science and not make science fit the methods.** Together, we are advancing impactful science at the intersection of **AI and human health**.

### Joining our laboratory
We form small teams comprising individuals with complementary expertise and work persistently to build comprehensive solutions. 

**Important:** If you are interested in joining us, then we encourage you to contact an active lab member (click on Team) and talk about your interests. We do not encourage you to email the PI directly before talking with the lab members.
